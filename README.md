## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

### What I learned

I haven't uploaded an Front End Mentor solution in a while that I thought I would have forgotten almost everything I learned but it turned out that I understood the concepts so well that all I went online for was syntax. It really reminded me of my work in Excel when I haven't used a particular feature in a while. I might not remember exactly how I got it accomplished but I knew it was possible and had doen it before. This made searching for the solution very simple. 

With this solution I started to leverage chatGPT to find answer to some of the problems I was running into. It was very helpful! I was finding solutions to items much faster than searching the web and since chatGPT explains what the thing does and why it was making the recommendation my understanding grew on the topics I asked it about. Big time saver. 

I especially enjoyed diving deep into concepts using AI. For example, I was having a difficult time understanding why Array.ForEach wouldn't work for variables that referenced a document.getElementbyClassName. The AI let me know that what I was doing was returning an array-like and not an array. This was something that I had glanced over when reading the MDN documentation but was something that really mattered when working with this kind of item. This really spead up my learning, now I know the return types of each of the "getElement" and "querySelector" items return and know how to better work with them going forward. 

I can definately see how AI can lead to intellectual lazyness. Using it to solve your problem rather then using it to help you solve the problem. I worry for our future programmers that might just use this to write their code with little understanding on how the code works. I'm doing these challenges as a hobby so I can build cool things and understand how those cool thing work. Therfore, I'm motivated to ask why and how but for someone that just needs a job or wants to simply deliver, that whole step of "why and how" could be skipped altogether robbing that person of the understanding of how this thing works. 

### Continued development

I told myself that I was going to complete all the newbie challenges in Front End Mentor before going to the Junior challenges but I belive at this stage I think I can handle them with little issues. Also, I'm not feeling tested anymore by the HTLM and CSS only technology challenges. They're too easy at this point. 

I do want to practice Grid, I've been saying this for several Front End Mentor challenges but I think I can get my exposure to this technology by doing the Juniour level challenges. 

I'm sticking to coding with only HTML, CSS and Javacsript without the use of frameworks or other tech for now. I want to get an appreciation for why these frameworks exists. I can't do that if I just jump into them and just watch the magic happen. I don't like magic, I like science. Show me the science!

I'll learn Tailwind, Sass, Svelt and other tech when I get to the Intermidete and Guru challenges.
